## Approach
    

-   Study publically available kernels
    
-   Participate in discussion forum
    
-   Build model by following standard guidelines
    
-   Improve the model performance
    

  

 ## Model
    

-   **Dataset**
    

An anonymized dataset containing numeric feature variables, the binary target column, and a string ID_code column with Train data shape - (200000, 202) & Test data shape - (200000, 201) was given.

  

-   **EDA**
    

Various graphs were plotted to understand dataset. For eg. countplot for target column, Kernel density estimation (kde) plot for each feature, correlation graph.

  

-   **Feature Generation**
    

Some new features were generated by applying statistical method like min, max value among features, summation of all features value, mean of all features etc.

  

-   **Light GBM Algorithm**
    

Decision tree-based algorithm LightGBM is used. It is a fast, distributed as well as high-performance gradient boosting framework.

  

-  **Parameter Tuning**
    

Various hyper-parameters were tuned to increase the performance like number of leaf, bagging fraction, feature fraction, min data in leaf etc.

  

 ## Result
    

Ended up in the top [9%  on LeaderBoard.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/leaderboard)
